# Faulty-Rocket

## Overview
Faulty Rocket is a typewriting game to help the user improve upon his or her typing skills. 
A random quote will be generated, and the user will be timed on how fast he or she completes typing the quote.
The words per minute will be calculated and used to determine the travel distance for the rocket. 
There are five checkpoints which are the different atmosphere layers: troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere, and exosphere.
The user must type at a certain speed to reach the next checkpoint. At each checkpoint, a new quote will be rendered 
for the user to complete. The user has 3 tries to get to the next checkpoint. Each try will render a new quote. If the user can not get to the next checkpoint within 3 tries, it is game over. The goal to get the rocket from the ground level to space, the exosphere.
